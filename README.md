# Clothing Store

Online Clothing Store gives buyers the power to buy shirts and pants for men and women. It provides users the capability to keep track of their items in their cart, how many did they order of the particular item, and how much the total cost of each order will sum up to. We used PostgreSQL to maintain each item title, price, order, order detail, order status, clothing type, and shopping cart. Some challenges faced was having the correct quantity of items ordered to be displayed in the cart. We had a script section that did not properly pass the data to the action controller and was soon resolved with identifying different parameter use cases. Some features that will be implemented in the future is the Stripe API to take in actual payments of user purchases. This will then be accustomed with security practices that will help maintain integrity and security of the system.
